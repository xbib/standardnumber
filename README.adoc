== What are standard numbers?

Standard numbers are numbers that have a defined syntax, drafted and maintained by
standard bodies, and embraced by organizations worldwide.
Standard numbers are considered to be unique.
They are assigned by the standard body or can be constructed in a specified manner to ensure uniqueness.
They can be checked for validity and most of them carry checksums.

The economic advantages of standard numbers are manifold

* they are compact
* they identify things or entities
* they can be printed, recognized, and compared for identification
* they can be processed by computers, for instance as a key in a database
* they are globally available
* they persist

The Java API for standard numbers provides

* a parser for standard numbers
* a formatter for standard numbers
* a checksum calculator
* and a validator for standard numbers

The following standard numbers are implemented

ARK, DOI, EAN, GTIN, IBAN, ISAN, ISBN, ISMN, ISNI, ISSN, ISTC, ISWC, ORCID, PPN, SICI, UPC, ZDB
