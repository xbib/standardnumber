== What are standard numbers?

Standard numbers are numbers that have a defined syntax, drafted and maintained by
standard bodies, and embraced by organizations worldwide.
Standard numbers are considered to be unique.
They are assigned by the standard body or can be constructed in a specified manner to ensure uniqueness.
They can be checked for validity and most of them carry checksums.

The economic advantages of standard numbers are manifold

* they are compact
* they identify things or entities
* they can be printed, recognized, and compared for identification
* they can be processed by computers, for instance as a key in a database
* they are globally available
* they persist

The Java API for standard numbers provides

* a parser for standard numbers
* a formatter for standard numbers
* a checksum calculator
* and a validator for standard numbers

The following standard numbers are implemented

ARK, DOI, EAN, GTIN, IBAN, ISAN, ISBN, ISMN, ISNI, ISSN, ISTC, ISWC, ORCID, PPN, SICI, UPC, ZDB

== ARK - Archival Resource Key

An ARK is a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that is a multi-purpose identifier
for information objects of any type. An ARK contains the label ark: after the
hostname, an URL request terminated by '?' returns a brief metadata record,
and an URL request terminated by '??' returns metadata that includes a commitment
statement from the current service provider.

The ARK and its inflections ('?' and '??') gain access to three facets of a
provider's ability to provide persistence.

Implicit in the design of the ARK scheme is that persistence is purely a matter
of service and not a property of a naming syntax.

== DOI - Digital Object Identifier System (ISO 26324, Z39.50 BIB-1 Use Attribute 1094)

DOI is an acronym for "digital object identifier", meaning a "digital identifier of an object"
rather than an "identifier of a digital object". The DOI system was initiated by the
International DOI Foundation in 1998, and initially developed with the collaboration
of some participants in ISO/TC46/SC9. Due to its application in the fields of
information and documentation and previous collaboration with some ISO/TC46/SC9 participants,
it was introduced as a possible work item in 2004 and further developed from 2006 to 2010.

The DOI system is designed to work over the Internet. A DOI name is permanently assigned
to an object to provide a resolvable persistent network link to current information about
that object, including where the object, or information about it, can be found on the
Internet. While information about an object can change over time, its DOI name will not
change. A DOI name can be resolved within the DOI system to values of one or more types
of data relating to the object identified by that DOI name, such as a URL, an e-mail address,
other identifiers and descriptive metadata.

The DOI system enables the construction of automated services and transactions.
Applications of the DOI system include but are not limited to managing information
and documentation location and access; managing metadata; facilitating electronic
transactions; persistent unique identification of any form of any data; and commercial
and non-commercial transactions.

The content of an object associated with a DOI name is described unambiguously
by DOI metadata, based on a structured extensible data model that enables the object
to be associated with metadata of any desired degree of precision and granularity
to support description and services. The data model supports interoperability
between DOI applications.

The scope of the DOI system is not defined by reference to the type of content
(format, etc.) of the referent, but by reference to the functionalities it provides
and the context of use. The DOI system provides, within networks of DOI applications,
for unique identification, persistence, resolution, metadata and semantic interoperability.

== EAN

European Article Number is a 13-digit barcoding standard for marking products
sold at retail point of sale.

Numbers encoded in UPC and EAN barcodes are known as
Global Trade Item Numbers (GTIN).

== GTIN - Global Trade Item Number

GTIN describes a family of GS1 (EAN.UCC) global data structures that employ
14 digits and can be encoded into various types of data carriers.

Currently, GTIN is used exclusively within bar codes, but it could also be used
in other data carriers such as radio frequency identification (RFID).
The GTIN is only a term and does not impact any existing standards, nor does
it place any additional requirements on scanning hardware.

For North American companies, the UPC is an existing form of the GTIN.

Since 2005, EAN International and American UCC merged to GS1 and also
EAN and UPC is now named GTIN.

The EAN/UCC-13 code is now officially called GTIN-13 (Global Trade Identifier Number).
Former 12-digit UPC codes can be converted into EAN/UCC-13 code by simply
adding a preceeding zero.

As of January 1, 2007, the former ISBN numbers have been integrated into
the EAN/UCC-13 code. For each old ISBN-10 code, there exists a proper translation
into EAN/UCC-13 by adding "978" as prefix.

The family of data structures comprising GTIN include

* GTIN-8 (EAN/UCC-8): this is an 8-digit number
* GTIN-12 (UPC-A): this is a 12-digit number
* GTIN-13 (EAN/UCC-13): this is a 13-digit number
* GTIN-14 (EAN/UCC-14 or ITF-14): this is a 14-digit number

== IBAN ISO 13616 International Bank Account Number (IBAN)

The International Bank Account Number (IBAN) is an internationally agreed means of
identifying bank accounts across national borders with a reduced risk of transcription
errors. It was originally adopted by the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS)
and later as an international standard under ISO 13616:1997. The current standard
is ISO 13616:2007, which indicates SWIFT as the formal registrar.

Checksum calculation is in accordance to ISO 7064 MOD-97.

== ISAN - ISO 15706 International Standard Audiovisual Number

The International Standard Audiovisual Number (ISAN) is a unique identifier for
audiovisual works and related versions, similar to ISBN for books.

It was developed within an ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation) TC46/SC9
working group. ISAN is managed and run by ISAN-IA.

The ISAN standard (ISO standard 15706:2002 and ISO 15706-2) is recommended or required
as the audiovisual identifier of choice for producers, studios, broadcasters,
Internet media providers and video games publishers who need to encode, track, and
distribute video in a variety of formats.

It provides a unique, internationally recognized and permanent reference number for each
audiovisual work and related versions registered in the ISAN system.

ISAN identifies works throughout their entire life cycle from conception, to production,
to distribution and consumption.

ISANs can be incorporated in both digital and physical media, such as theatrical
release prints, DVDs, publications, advertising, marketing materials and packaging,
as well as licensing contracts to uniquely identify works.

The ISAN identifier is incorporated in many draft and final standards such as
AACS, DCI, MPEG, DVB, and ATSC.

== ISBN - International Standard Book Number (ISO 2108, Z39.50 BIB-1 Use Attribute 7)

The International Standard Book Number is a 13-digit number
that uniquely identifies books and book-like products published
internationally.

The purpose of the ISBN is to establish and identify one title or
edition of a title from one specific publisher
and is unique to that edition, allowing for more efficient marketing of products by booksellers,
libraries, universities, wholesalers and distributors.

Every ISBN consists of thirteen digits and whenever it is printed it is preceded by the letters ISBN.
The thirteen-digit number is divided into four parts of variable length, each part separated by a hyphen.

This class is based upon the ISBN converter and formatter class by

== ISMN - International Standard Music Number (ISO 10957, Z39.50 BIB-1 Use Attribute 1092)

The International Standard Music Number (ISMN) is a thirteen-character alphanumeric identifier
for printed music developed by ISO. The original proposal for an ISMN was made by the
UK Branch of IAML (International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation
Centres).

The original format comprised four elements: a distinguishing prefix M, a publisher ID,
an item ID and a check digit, typically looking like M-2306-7118-7.

From 1 January 2008 the ISMN was defined as a thirteen digit identifier beginning 979-0 where
the zero replaced M in the old-style number. The resulting number is identical with its
EAN-13 number as encoded in the item's barcode.

== ISNI - International Standard Name Identifier (ISO 27729)

The International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI) is a method for uniquely identifying
the public identities of contributors to media content such as books, TV programmes,
and newspaper articles. Such an identifier consists of 16 numerical digits divided
into four blocks.

Checksum calculation is in accordance to ISO/IEC 7064:2003, MOD 11-2.
 
== ISSN - International Standard Serial Number (ISO 3297, Z39.50 BIB-1 Use Attribute 8)

The International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) is a unique
eight-digit number used to identify a print or electronic periodical
publication. The ISSN system was adopted as international standard
ISO 3297 in 1975. The ISO subcommittee TC 46/SC 9 is responsible
for the standard.

The ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) is an eight-digit number
which identifies periodical publications as such, including electronic
serials.

The ISSN is a numeric code which is used as an identifier: it has no
signification in itself and does not contain in itself any information
referring to the origin or contents of the publication.

The ISSN takes the form of the acronym ISSN followed by two groups
of four digits, separated by a hyphen. The eighth character is a
control digit calculated according to a modulo 11 algorithm on
the basis of the 7 preceding digits; this eighth control character
may be an "X" if the result of the computing is equal to "10",
in order to avoid any ambiguity.

The ISSN is linked to a standardized form of the title of the
identified serial, known as the "key title", which repeats
the title of the publication, qualifying it with additional elements
in order to distinguish it from other publications having identical
titles.

If the title of the publication changes in any significant way,
a new ISSN must be assigned in order to correspond to this new form
of title and avoid any confusion. A serial publication whose
title is modified several times in the course of its existence
will be assigned each time a new ISSN, thus allowing precise
identification of each form of the title : in fact it is then
considered that they are different publications even if there
is a logical link between them.

Contrary to other types of publications, the world of serial
publications is particularly changeable and complex :
the lifetime of a title may be extremely short; many publications
may be part of a complex set of relationships, etc.
These particularities themselves necessitated the introduction
of the ISSN.

== ISTC - International Standard Text Code (ISO 21047)

The International Standard Text Code (ISTC) is a numbering system for the unique identification
of text-based works; the term âworkâ can refer to any content appearing in conventional
printed books, audio-books, static e-books or enhanced digital books, as well as content
which might appear in a newspaper or journal.

The ISTC provides sales analysis systems, retail websites, library catalogs and other
bibliographic systems with a method of automatically linking together publications
of the âsame contentâ and/or ârelated contentâ, thus improving discoverability of
products and efficiencies.

An ISTC number is the link between a userâs search for a piece of content and the
ultimate sale or loan of a publication.

The standard was formally published in March 2009.

Checksum algorithm is ISO 7064 MOD 16/3.

== ISWC - International Standard Musical Work Code (ISO 15707)

International Standard Musical Work Code (ISWC) is a unique identifier for
musical works, similar to ISBN.

Its primary purpose is in collecting society administration, and to clearly identify works in
legal contracts. It would also be useful in library cataloging.

Due to the fact that a musical work can have multiple authors, it is inevitable that,
on rare occasions, a duplicate ISWC might exist and might not be detected immediately.

Because of the existing business practices among collecting societies, it is not possible
to simply declare an ISWC as obsolete. In such cases, as soon as they are identified,
the system will deal with duplicate registrations by linking such registration records
in the ISWC database.

== ORCID - Open Researcher and Contributor ID

ORCID is compatible to International Standard Name Identifier (ISNI, ISO 2772).

Checksum calculation is according to ISO/IEC 7064:2003, MOD 11-2.

== PPN - Pica Productie Nummer

A catalog record numbering system, uniquely identifying records, used by PICA
(Project voor geIntegreerde Catalogus Automatisering) integrated library systems.

== SICII - Serial Item and Contribution Identifier (Z39.56)

The SICI code (Serial Item and Contribution Identifier) is described in the
American standard ANSI/NISO Z39.56. The SICI code is known among
international scientific publishers and reproduction rights agencies.
The SICI even provides for the unambiguous identification of each article
or contribution published in a given issue of a serial publication.

The SICI contains

* the ISSN

* the date of publication, between brackets and formatted according to the
formula YYYYMM

* the issue number

* the version number of the standard, here 1, preceded by a semicolon

* and lastly a hyphen which precedes the control character calculated
on the basis of all the preceding characters

Example:
++++
0095-4403(199502/03)21:3&lt;12:WATIIB&gt;2.0.TX;2-J
++++

== UPC - Universal Product Code (ISO 15420)

The Universal Product Code (UPC) is a barcode symbology (i.e., a specific type of barcode)
that is widely used in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia,
New Zealand and in other countries for tracking trade items in stores.
Its most common form, the UPC-A, consists of 12 numerical digits, which are uniquely
assigned to each trade item.

Along with the related EAN barcode, the UPC is the barcode mainly used for scanning
of trade items at the point of sale, per GS1 specifications.

UPC data structures are a component of GTINs (Global Trade Item Numbers).

All of these data structures follow the global GS1 specification which bases on
international standards.

== ZDB - Zeitschriftendatenbank-ID

ZDB is the worldâs largest specialized database for serial titles (journals, annuals, newspapers, also
e-journals).
